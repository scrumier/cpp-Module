# C++ Modules Overview üìò

Welcome to the collection of my C++ modules! Here you'll find an overview of various projects and assignments that showcase my journey through mastering C++ fundamentals, from object-oriented programming to advanced concepts like concurrency.

## üöÄ Modules

### Module 00: Basics of C++
This module covers the essentials of C++, including syntax, data types, and basic I/O operations. It‚Äôs all about getting comfortable with the core language features and writing simple programs.

### Module 01: Memory Allocation and Pointers
Diving deeper, this module explores dynamic memory management, pointers, and references in C++. It‚Äôs a crucial step in understanding how memory works in C++ and managing resources effectively.

### Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, and I/O Streams
This module focuses on operator overloading and polymorphism through ad-hoc techniques. It covers custom operator definitions and how to manage input and output streams, making C++ code more intuitive.

### Module 03: Inheritance and Interfaces
Here, I delve into inheritance, virtual functions, and abstract classes. This module is all about understanding how to design and implement hierarchies and interfaces, foundational for any object-oriented developer.

### Module 04: Polymorphism and Casts
An advanced exploration of polymorphism, this module goes into the use of dynamic and static casting. It emphasizes managing multiple inheritance and ensuring type safety in complex systems.

### Module 05: Exceptions and File I/O
This module tackles exception handling and file management. Handling errors gracefully and working with file I/O operations is essential for robust C++ programs, and this module provides a solid foundation.

### Module 06: STL Containers and Algorithms
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful part of C++. This module covers the main containers like `vector`, `map`, `list`, and introduces algorithms to perform operations efficiently.

### Module 07: Templates
This module introduces templates for writing generic code, an important skill in modern C++ programming. It includes function and class templates, enabling reusable and type-safe programming.

### Module 08: Smart Pointers and Resource Management
Resource management is key in C++. This module covers smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`) for automated memory management, helping prevent memory leaks and making code safer.

### Module 09: Advanced Sorting Algorithms - Ford-Johnson Sorting
In this module, I explore the Ford-Johnson sorting algorithm, also known as the Merge-Insertion Sort. This algorithm is known for its efficiency and optimal sorting performance. The module focuses on implementing and analyzing the algorithm's complexity, providing insights into advanced sorting techniques.

## üìà Goals and Outcomes
Each module builds on the previous one, gradually introducing more complex C++ concepts and focusing on practical skills. By the end, I developed a strong understanding of both the syntax and the philosophy behind C++ programming.

## ü§ù Collaboration & Feedback
Feel free to explore each module, and if you have suggestions or questions, I'm always open to collaboration and feedback.
